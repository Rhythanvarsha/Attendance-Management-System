       An AMS as the name suggests is an important tool that helps organizations manage their employeesâ€™ attendance data electronically. This blog will help you in developing an AMS from scratch using Advanced Java..

From this paper, we will discuss the language and its interface, crucial terminologies, necessary modules and packages, how to execute the code, actual code elaboration, as well as output.
Required Modules and Packages:

**To build the Attendance Management System, the following modules and packages are required**:

**Java Development Kit (JDK):** The essential toolkit for Java development.

**Servlet API:** For handling server-side business logic.

**JSP API:** To develop the user interface with dynamic content.

**JDBC API:** For database connectivity.

**Apache Tomcat:** A web server to deploy and run your Java web applications.

**MySQL/PostgreSQL:** A relational database to store attendance records.
**How to Run the Code:**
To run the Attendance Management System, follow these steps:

**Set Up the Environment:**
Install JDK, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, and Apache Tomcat.
Set up the database (e.g., MySQL) and create tables for users, attendance records, etc.
**Configure the Project:**
Import the necessary libraries (Servlet, JSP, JDBC) into your IDE.
Configure Tomcat in your IDE for deployment.
**Deploy the Application:**
Write the Java code (Servlets, JSP) and connect it with the database using JDBC.
Deploy the project on Tomcat and start the server.
**Access the Application:**
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/AttendanceManagementSystem.
Log in using the provided credentials and start managing attendance.
